# git-bashrc

It's a survival wrapper toolkit for git to get around the complex git commands ! this was written specifically for git bash but can also be used in a real linux shell

To use just copy this file to your home directory and rename the file to .bashrc and use source ~/.bashrc to take effect or re-open git bash
